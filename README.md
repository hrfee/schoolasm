### *school-asm*

An attempt at an interpreter (compiler and VM, maybe?) for a made up instruction set inspired by what was in my A level exam questions.
```shell
go build github.com/hrfee/schoolasm
./schoolasm hello.asm
```
Instructions and encoded format are explained in `spec.txt`.

### *license*

no license, why would you want to modify/distribute this?

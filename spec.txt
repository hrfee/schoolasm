Mostly from the Syllabus, some instructions were unique to the question.

01 LDM     #n          Load number n into the ACC.
02 LDD     <address>   Load whatever's in <address> into the ACC.
03 LDI     <address>   Load whatever's in the address stored in <address> to the ACC.
04 LDX     <address>   Load whatever's in <address> + <contents of IX> into the ACC.
05 LDR     #n          Load number n into the IX.
06 STO     <address>   Write the contents of ACC in <address>.
07 ADD     <address>   Add the contents of <address> to the ACC.
08 INC     <register>  Increment (+1) <register>, either ACC or IX.
09 DEC     <register>  Decrement (-1) <register>, either ACC or IX.
10 JMP     <address>   Jump to <address>.
11 CMP     <address>   Compare the ACC to whatever's in <address>. Note the order of these for other instructions.
   CMP     #n          Compare, but with n rather than an address.
12 JPE     <address>   Jump to <address> if the previous CMP showed values were identical.
13 JPN     <address>   Jump to <address> if the previous CMP showed values were not identical.
        
14 JGT     <address>   Jump to <address> if the previous CMP showed ACC contents were greater than the contents of the compared address.
        
15 JLT     <address>   JGT, but if less than.

16 IN                  Blocks until a single character and a newline (enter) is entered in stdin. The ASCII ordinate is stored in the ACC.
17 OUT                 Output the character corresponding the ASCII ordinate in the ACC to stdout.
18 END                 Exit with a zero code. (may add other exit codes in future)

Constant values (#n) must be 16 bit to fit into memory.
Op structure:
Greatest bit: 1 = value is a constant value, 0 = value is an address.
Next greatest 15 bits: Opcode. See ops.go.
The rest are the address or value.

Addresses are 16 bit
Memory blocks/Registers are 32-bit
Memory size is 8192 bits (32 bits * 256)
COMP is a register used for CMP comparisions.
    COMP == 1: Identical
    COMP == 0: ACC Less than val
    COMP == 2: ACC Greater than val
COMP at 252, PC at 253, ACC at 254, IX at 255

Memory address 0 jumps to the first instruction.
